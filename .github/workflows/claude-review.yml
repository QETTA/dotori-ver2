            Review this PR for the Dotori project (Korean childcare facility finder).
            Tech stack: Next.js 16.1, React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Tailwind CSS 4, Mongoose 8, MongoDB Atlas M10+.
            Focus on:
            - TypeScript type safety (no `any`)
            - Security issues (XSS, injection, exposed secrets)
            - Korean UI text correctness
            - Mobile-first responsive design (375x812 viewport)
            - Performance implications (MongoDB M10 connection pool awareness)
            - Brand design system compliance (dotori-* colors, motion/react animations)
            - Mongoose query efficiency (20K+ documents in facilities collection)
